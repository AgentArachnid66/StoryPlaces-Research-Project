The JSON formatter can be used to read in the JSON in it's original format and and it saves a JSON that can be used in PANDAS. Follow the instructions in the script and paste the file path in the variable and run it and you'll have a workable JSON in the script directory.

The CTINResearch script performs the exploratory data analysis and saves the result as the csv files also included. This is so we can access the relevant datasets without rerunning script and cells.
